				<td>TERMS</td>
				<td>DEFINITIONS</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Machine Language</td>
				<td>Machine code, also known as machine language, is the elemental language of computers. It is read by the computer's central processing unit (CPU), is composed of digital binary numbers and looks like a very long sequence of zeros and ones.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
				<td>Debugging</td>
				<td>Debugging, in computer programming and engineering, is a multistep process that involves identifying a problem, isolating the source of the problem and then either correcting the problem or determining a way to work around it.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Assembler</td>
				<td>An assembler is a program that takes basic computer instructions and converts them into a pattern of bits that the computer's processor can use to perform its basic operations. Some people call these instructions assembler language and others use the term assembly language.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Assembly language</td>
				<td>In computer programming, assembly language, often referred to simply as Assembly and commonly abbreviated as ASM or asm, is any low-level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Translator</td>
				<td>A translator is a program that converts source code into machine code. Generally, there are three types of translator: compilers. interpreters. assemblers.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Compiler</td>
				<td>A compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language. The source code is typically written in a high-level, human-readable language such as Java or C++.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
				<td>Interpreter</td>
				<td>An interpreter translates source code into object code one instruction at a time. It is similar to a human translator translating what a person says into another language, sentence by sentence. The resulting object code is then executed immediately. The process is called interpretation .</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
				<td>Cross-platform software</td>
				<td>In computing, cross-platform software is computer software that is designed to work in several computing platforms.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Natural Language</td>
				<td>In neuropsychology, linguistics, and philosophy of language, a natural language or ordinary language is any language that has evolved naturally in humans through use and repetition without conscious planning or premeditation. Natural languages can take different forms, such as speech or signing.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Formal Language</td>
				<td>In automata theory, a formal language is a set of strings of symbols drawn from a finite alphabet. A formal language can be specified either by a set of rules (such as regular expressions or a context-free grammar) that generates the language, or by a formal machine that accepts (recognizes) the language.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Machine-Iindependent </td>
				<td>A term applied to software that is not dependent on the properties of a particular machine, and can therefore be used on any machine. Such software is also described as portable. A Dictionary of Computing. "machine-independent ."</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>High-Level Language</td>
				<td>A high-level language is any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Object-Oriented Programming</td>
				<td>Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields, and the code is in the form of procedures. A common feature of objects is that procedures are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Scripting Language</td>
				<td>A scripting language or script language is a programming language that is used to manipulate, customize, and automate the facilities of an existing system. Scripting languages are usually interpreted at runtime rather than compiled. </td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Data Type</td>
				<td><p>INTEGER: The INTEGER data type stores whole numbers that range from -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647 for 9 or 10 digits of precision. The number 2,147,483,648 is a reserved value and cannot be used. The INTEGER value is stored as a signed binary integer and is typically used to store counts, quantities, and so on.</p><p>FLOAT: In computer science, a float is a data type composed of a number that is not an integer, because it includes a fraction represented in decimal format.</p>
                <p>STRING: The string data types are CHAR , VARCHAR , BINARY , VARBINARY , BLOB , TEXT , ENUM , and SET .</p></td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Primitive Data Types</td>
				<td>In computer science, primitive data types are a set of basic data types from which all other data types are constructed. Specifically it often refers to the limited set of data representations in use by a particular processor, which all compiled programs must use. Most processors support a similar set of primitive data types, although the specific representations vary.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Data Structure</td>
				<td>A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Python Collection Data Structures</td>
				<td><p>LIST: <br />mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br />List Items
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.</p>

<p>TUPLE: <br />mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
<br />Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

Tuples are written with round brackets.</p>

<p>SET: <br />myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
<br />Set
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.</p>

<p>DICTIONARY: <br />thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
<br />Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.

Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

			</tr><tr>
				<td>Function</td>
				<td>A function is simply a “chunk” of code that you can use over and over again, rather than writing it out multiple times. Functions enable programmers to break down or decompose a problem into smaller chunks, each of which performs a particular task.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Local Variable</td>
				<td>In computer science, a local variable is a variable that is given local scope. A local variable reference in the function or block in which it is declared overrides the same variable name in the larger scope.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Global Variables</td>
				<td> A global variable is a variable that is declared outside any function and is accessible to all routines in our program. So, its scope is global: it's initialized when we run our software and lasts while the program is running. We mostly declare global variables at the top of a module file.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
				<td>Source Program</td>
				<td>A source program is a text file that contains instructions written in a high level language. It can not be executed (made to run) by a processor without some additional steps. A source program is also called a source file, source code, or sometimes, just source.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Object Code</td>
				<td>Object code generally refers to the output, a compiled file, which is produced when the Source Code is compiled with a C compiler. The object code file contains a sequence of machine-readable instructions that is processed by the CPU in a computer.</td>
