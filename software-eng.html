				<td>Software life Cycle: DEVELOPMENT PHASE</td>
				<td>*Planning and Requirement Analysis <br/><br/>Requirement analysis is the most important and fundamental stage in SDLC. It is performed by the senior members of the team with inputs from the customer, the sales department, market surveys and domain experts in the industry. This information is then used to plan the basic project approach and to conduct product feasibility study in the economical, operational and technical areas.

Planning for the quality assurance requirements and identification of the risks associated with the project is also done in the planning stage. The outcome of the technical feasibility study is to define the various technical approaches that can be followed to implement the project successfully with minimum risks.
<br/><br/>
*Designing the Product Architecture<br/><br/>SRS is the reference for product architects to come out with the best architecture for the product to be developed. Based on the requirements specified in SRS, usually more than one design approach for the product architecture is proposed and documented in a DDS - Design Document Specification.

This DDS is reviewed by all the important stakeholders and based on various parameters as risk assessment, product robustness, design modularity, budget and time constraints, the best design approach is selected for the product.

A design approach clearly defines all the architectural modules of the product along with its communication and data flow representation with the external and third party modules (if any). The internal design of all the modules of the proposed architecture should be clearly defined with the minutest of the details in DDS.<br/><br/>

*Impelmentation<br/><br/>In this stage of SDLC the actual development starts and the product is built. The programming code is generated as per DDS during this stage. If the design is performed in a detailed and organized manner, code generation can be accomplished without much hassle.

Developers must follow the coding guidelines defined by their organization and programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are used to generate the code. Different high level programming languages such as C, C++, Pascal, Java and PHP are used for coding. The programming language is chosen with respect to the type of software being developed.<br/><br/>

*Testing<br/><br/>This stage is usually a subset of all the stages as in the modern SDLC models, the testing activities are mostly involved in all the stages of SDLC. However, this stage refers to the testing only stage of the product where product defects are reported, tracked, fixed and retested, until the product reaches the quality standards defined in the SRS.<br/><br/>

				<td>Modular Implementation</td>
				<td>Modular programming has been around since the 60s and is a foundation of any good software architecture. Across many industries that were once hardware-dominated, software architecture is surfacing as a critical bottleneck for delivering the best products to the market first. Simultaneously, the share of R&D spending on software development is increasing rapidly.

The main issue is that software has grown organically within these products. If the perspective hasn't been raised and a unified modular software architecture has been set up, there is an evident risk that you end up with many different monolithic software platforms, each designed for a narrow subset of your products. This issue makes your development slow and costly, with poor output.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>UML (Unified Modeling Language) </td>
				<td>UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standard language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems. UML was created by the Object Management Group (OMG) and UML 1.0 specification draft was proposed to the OMG in January 1997.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Use case</td>
				<td>In software and systems engineering, the phrase use case is a polyseme with two senses: A usage scenario for a piece of software; often used in the plural to suggest situations where a piece of software may be useful. A potential scenario in which a system receives an external request and responds to it. </td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Use case diagram</td>
				<td>A use case diagram is a graphical depiction of a user's possible interactions with a system. A use case diagram shows various use cases and different types of users the system has and will often be accompanied by other types of diagrams as well. The use cases are represented by either circles or ellipses. The actors are often shown as stick figures.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Data Relaionshhip</td>
				<td>*One-to-One <br/><br/>In systems analysis, a one-to-one relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities A and B in which one element of A may only be linked to one element of B, and vice versa. In mathematical terms, there exists a bijective function from A to B.<br/><br/>
                
                *One-to-Many<br/><br/>In systems analysis, a one-to-many relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities A and B in which an element of A may be linked to many elements of B, but a member of B is linked to only one element of A. For instance, think of A as books, and B as pages.<br/><br/>
                
                *Many-to-Many<br/><br/>In systems analysis, a many-to-many relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities, say, A and B, where A may contain a parent instance for which there are many children in B and vice versa.               
                
                </td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Design Patterns</td>
				<td>In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Software Quality Assurance</td>
				<td>Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is a process that assures that all software engineering processes, methods, activities, and work items are monitored and comply with the defined standards. These defined standards could be one or a combination of anything like ISO 9000, CMMI model, ISO15504, etc.

SQA incorporates all software development processes starting from defining requirements to coding until release. Its prime goal is to ensure quality.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>Software Testing</td>
				<td>*Glass Box Testing <br/><br/>
                
                A white box is a subsystem whose internals can be viewed but usually not altered. The term is used in systems engineering, software engineering, and in intelligent user interface design, where it is closely related to recent interest in explainable artificial intelligence.
                <br/><br/>
                
                *Black Box Testing<br/><br/>
                Black-box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings. This method of test can be applied virtually to every level of software testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance.
                <br/><br/>
                *Beta Testing<br/><br/>In software development, a beta test is the second phase of software testing in which a sampling of the intended audience tries the product out. Beta is the second letter of the Greek alphabet. Originally, the term alpha test meant the first phase of testing in a software development process.
                 <br/><br/>
                 * Alpha Testing<br/><br/>The main objective of alpha testing is to refine the software product by finding and fixing the bugs that were not discovered through previous tests. Alpha testing is typically performed by in-house software engineers or QA staff. It is the final testing stage before the software is released into the real world.

			</tr><tr>
				<td>Documentation</td>
				<td>*User Documentation<br/><br/>User documentation is the content that you provide the end user in order for them to be more successful with your product or service. Also known as user guides, instruction manuals, or user manuals, user documentation is there to hold your customer's hand as they learn about your product.
                <br/><br/>
                *System Documentation<br/><br/>System documentation represents documents that describe the system itself and its parts. It includes requirements documents, design decisions, architecture descriptions, program source code, and FAQs. User documentation covers manuals that are mainly prepared for end-users of the product and system administrators.
                 <br/><br/>
                * Technical Documentation<br/><br/>Technical documentation can take many forms, but its main purpose is to explain the features and functionality of your product. This includes details on the product roadmaps and plans, software architecture, design process, and intended applications.

				<td>Intellectual Property Law</td>
				<td>*Software License<br/><br/>
                A software license is a document that provides legally binding guidelines for the use and distribution of software. Software licenses typically provide end users with the right to one or more copies of the software without violating copyrights.
                <br/><br/>
                *Software Disclaimer<br/><br/>A software disclaimer is the software developer's formal notice to the user of its software that the developer is denying any and all liability for any damages arising out of using the software as well as denying any implied warranties.<br/><br/>
                *Best defense against software liabilities claims<br/><br/>
                Keep firewall and antivirus software updated. Ensure software is updated with the latest security patches to protect your clients from security vulnerabilities.<br/>
                Maintain your property. For example, a broken step or icy sidewalk could result in a customer injury.  Evaluate any slip-and-fall risks and promptly address them.<br/>
                Train your client on cybersecurity best practices. Educate your client about the importance of strong passwords and how to spot suspicious downloads or phishing attempts.
