                    Q. What is version control system ?<p>Ans: A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As developers make changes to the project, any earlier version of the project can be recovered at any time.

Developers can review project history to find out:

<li>Which changes were made?</li>
<li>Who made the changes?</li>
<li>When were the changes made?</li>
<li>Why were changes needed?</li></p>

                    Q. What is GIT ?<p>Ans: Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

                 <ul>
                    <li>Repository <p>A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.</p></li>
                    <li>Commit<p>On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository. On the main page of the repository, above the file list, click commits. To navigate to a specific commit, click the commit message for that commit. To see what branch the commit is on, check the label below the commit message.</p></li>
                    <li>Fork<p>A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository.</p></li>
                     <li>Push<p>Git push updates the remote branch with local commits. It is one of the four commands in Git that prompts interaction with the remote repository. You can also think of git push as update or publish. By default, git push only updates the corresponding branch on the remote.</p></li> 
                     <li>Pull Requests<p>Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.</p></li> 
                     <li>Workflows<p>A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository and will run when triggered by an event in your repository, or they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule.</p></li>
                     <li>Issues<p>Issues let you track your work on GitHub, where development happens. When you mention an issue in another issue or pull request, the issue's timeline reflects the cross-reference so that you can keep track of related work. To indicate that work is in progress, you can link an issue to a pull request.</p></li>
                     <li>Raw Button<p>The Raw button, like the name suggests, opens the file in a raw form, meaning that any HTML formatting disappears. This is particularly useful when you want to download a single file.</p></li>
                     <li>Blame Button<p>The git blame command is used to examine the contents of a file line by line and see when each line was last modified and who the author of the modifications was. The output format of git blame can be altered with various command line options.</p></li>
