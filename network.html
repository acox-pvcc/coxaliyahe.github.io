By contrast, a wide area network not only covers a larger geographic distance, but also generally involves leased telecommunication circuits.</p></li>
                    <li>MAN<p>A metropolitan area network is a computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a metropolitan area.</p></li>
                    <li>WAN<p>A wide area network is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographic area. Wide area networks are often established with leased telecommunication circuits.</p></li>

                    <li>Bus Network <p>A bus network is a network topology in which nodes are directly connected to a common half-duplex link called a bus. A host on a bus network is called a station. In a bus network, every station will receive all network traffic, and the traffic generated by each station has equal transmission priority</p></li>
                    <li>Star Network<p>A star network is an implementation of a spoke–hub distribution paradigm in computer networks. In a star network, every host is connected to a central hub. In its simplest form, one central hub acts as a conduit to transmit messages. The star network is one of the most common computer network topologies.</p></li>

It uses carrier-sensing to defer transmissions until no other stations are transmitting.</p></li>
                    <li>CSMA/CD WIFI<p>Carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) is a protocol for carrier transmission in 802.11 networks. It was developed to minimize the potential of a collision occurring when two or more stations send their signals over a data link layer.</p></li>

                 <ul>
                    <li>Repeater <p>A repeater is a powerful network hardware device that regenerates an incoming signal from the sender before retransmitting it to the receiver. It is also known as a signal booster, and it helps in extending the coverage area of networks. The Incoming data can be in optical, wireless or electrical signals.</p></li>
                    <li>Bridge<p>A network bridge is a computer networking device that creates a single, aggregate network from multiple communication networks or network segments. This function is called network bridging. Bridging is distinct from routing.</p></li>
                    <li>Switch<p>A network switch connects devices in a network to each other, enabling them to talk by exchanging data packets. Switches can be hardware devices that manage physical networks or software-based virtual devices. A network switch operates on the data-link layer, or Layer 2, of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.</p></li>
                    <li>Router<p>A router is a physical or virtual appliance that passes information between two or more packet-switched computer networks. A router inspects a given data packet's destination Internet Protocol address (IP address), calculates the best way for it to reach its destination and then forwards it accordingly.</p></li>
                    <li>Gateway<p>A gateway is a network node used in telecommunications that connects two networks with different transmission protocols together. Gateways serve as an entry and exit point for a network as all data must pass through or communicate with the gateway prior to being routed.</p></li>

                    <li>Tier 2<p>A Tier 2 network is an Internet service provider which engages in the practice of peering with other networks, but which also purchases IP transit to reach some portion of the Internet.</p></li>
