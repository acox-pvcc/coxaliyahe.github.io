                    <p>Types of Testing: </p>
                    <li>Acceptance testing: Verifying whether the whole system works as intended.</li><br/>
                   <li>Integration testing: Ensuring that software components or functions operate together.</li><br/>
                  <li>Unit testing: Validating that each software unit performs as expected. A unit is the smallest testable component of an application.</li>
                  <li>Functional testing: Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on functional requirements. Black-box testing is a common way to verify functions.</li><br/>
                  <li>Performance testing: Testing how the software performs under different workloads. Load testing, for example, is used to evaluate performance under real-life load conditions.</li><br/>
                  <li>Regression testing: Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality. Sanity testing can be used to verify menus, functions and commands at the surface level, when there is no time for a full regression test.</li><br/>
                  <li>Stress testing: Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails. Considered to be a type of non-functional testing.</li><br/>
                  <li>Usability testing: Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task.</li><br/>

                    <p>Software testing is done to detect: <p>Though testing itself costs money, companies can save millions per year in development and support if they have a good testing technique and QA processes in place. Early software testing uncovers problems before a product goes to market. The sooner development teams receive test feedback, the sooner they can address issues such as:</p></p>
                    
                    <li>Architectural flaws</li>
                    <li>Poor design decisions
</li>
                    <li>Invalid or incorrect functionality
</li>
                    <li>Security vulnerabilities
</li>
                    <li>Scalability issues
</li>
                </ul>
                
                 <ul>
                    <p>Testing Best Practice: </p>
                    
                    <li>Continuous testing: Project teams test each build as it becomes available. This type of software testing relies on test automation that is integrated with the deployment process. It enables software to be validated in realistic test environments earlier in the process â€“ improving design and reducing risks.</li> <br/>
                    <li>Configuration management: Organizations centrally maintain test assets and track what software builds to test. Teams gain access to assets such as code, requirements, design documents, models, test scripts and test results. Good systems include user authentication and audit trails to help teams meet compliance requirements with minimal administrative effort.
</li><br/>
                    <li>Service virtualization: Testing environments may not be available, especially early in code development. Service virtualization simulates the services and systems that are missing or not yet completed, enabling teams to reduce dependencies and test sooner. They can reuse, deploy and change a configuration to test different scenarios without having to modify the original environment.
</li><br/>
                    <li>Defect or bug tracking: Monitoring defects is important to both testing and development teams for measuring and improving quality. Automated tools allow teams to track defects, measure their scope and impact, and uncover related issues.
</li><br/>
                    <li>Metrics and reporting: Reporting and analytics enable team members to share status, goals and test results. Advanced tools integrate project metrics and present results in a dashboard. Teams quickly see the overall health of a project and can monitor relationships between test, development and other project elements.
